# Food World

Food World will be a 2D top-down, open-world video game that takes place in what seems to be a world of food. All of the characters and areas in the game will be food-based, aside from the human character that the user will play as. Food World will present itself with a colorful and cartoony artstyle, a playful and humorous tone, a creative and detailed story, and entertaining and engaging gameplay. 


# Project Organization
images: a folder that contains all of Ryan's artwork.
resources: a folder that contains different types of .tres Resource files that hold game data.
scenes: a folder that contains various Godot Scene objects, such as the Game, the Player, Characters, and much more.
scripts: a folder that contains all code files, many of which (but not all) are attached to Scenes in the scenes folder.


# How To Run The Game
In this repository, you can find two files that will run the game.

If you are on Windows, download and run the FoodWorld.exe file.
If you are on Mac, unzip the FoodWorldGame.zip file, download and the file contents, and run the executable.


# Viewing the Code
The best way to view the code is most definitely through Godot's built-in code editor. It includes vast amounts of documentation, and by holding CTRL and clicking on class names, methods, and variables, you can instantly view the documentation for that specific component.
Other code editors can be used perfectly fine as well, but they might not be as optimal and you wouldn't be able to run the game like you would be able to through the editor.
