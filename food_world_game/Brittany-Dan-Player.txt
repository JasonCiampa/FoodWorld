3. Player: Brittany, we have to find more berries for your sauna.
4. Player: We're starting to run low on juice boxes.


5. Dan: Yeah, we used a lot of them against those rotten foods.
6. Dan: They just keep coming! So many of them!


7. Brittany: I agree, we should find more berries. My sauna is empty right now!
8. Brittany: The problem is, this area is pretty scarce on berry bushes.


9. Dan: The sugar forest has tons of berry bushes.
10. Dan: The place is practically hopping with berries!


11. Player: Great, let's make our way there.

3. Dan: Jeez! Those guys nearly had us!
4. Dan: I think I jellied my dough.


5. Player: What?


6. Brittany: Yeah... what?


7. Dan: I think I jellied my dough.


8. Player: What does that mean?


9. Dan: I think some of my jelly spilled out from my dough.
10. Dan: When I get scared I leak a little.


11. Brittany: Oh. Gotcha.


12. Player: I think that's the human equivalent of peeing your pants.


13. Dan: What are pants?

3. Brittany: Dan, what's your favorite color?


4. Dan: Probably orange. What about yours?


5. Brittany: Mine is blue.


6. Player: That seems a bit biased considering you're blue.


7. Brittany: I'm blue BECAUSE it's my favorite color. It's not my favorite color because I'm blue.


8. Player: So you chose your own color?


9. Brittany: Yep.


10. Player: I'm not buying it.


11. Brittany: Well what's your favorite color then?


12. Player: I like pink.


13. Dan: I'm pink!




Bouncy Berries

3. Player: Hey Brittany, how are we looking on juice?


4. Brittany: We're running pretty low right now, but we've got some berries in my sauna right now.


5. Player: Tell them to hurry up in there, we need that juice to make more juice boxes.


6. Brittany: Woah woah woah, slow your roll there chief.
7. Brittany: A berry's sauna experience is not to be disrupted. It's a sacred time.


8. Dan: What's so special about the sauna?


9. Brittany: Well you see, berries regenerate their juice over time.
10. Brittany: The more juice a berry has, the heavier it ends up being.
11. Brittany: Berries love to hop around, but as they accumulate more juice, it becomes harder to bounce with their extra weight.
12. Brittany:  The sauna allows them to reset their bodies and get back to doing what they love.
13. Brittany: Berries deeply look forward to it, so there's no way we can rush them.


14. Player: Interesting. I wonder how high they can hop right after being done in the sauna.

7. Dan: I just gotta pop it out real quick, hold on...


8. Player: Hey! Watch it! You sent that sprinkle flying right at me!


9. Dan: Oh no! Did it hit you?!


10. Player: No, it didn't, but-


11. Dan: Thank goodness, no harm no foul then!


12. Brittany: Um- yeah foul! You almost impaled him with your-
