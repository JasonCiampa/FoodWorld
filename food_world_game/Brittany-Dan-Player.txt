3. Player: Brittany, we have to find more berries for your sauna.
4. Player: We’re starting to run low on juice boxes.


5. Dan: Yeah, we used a lot of them against those rotten foods.
6. Dan: They just keep coming! So many of them!


7. Brittany: I agree, we should find more berries. My sauna is empty right now!
8. Brittany: The problem is, this area is pretty scarce on berry bushes.


9. Dan: The sugar forest has tons of berry bushes.
10. Dan: The place is practically hopping with berries!

3. Dan: Jeez! Those guys nearly had us!
4. Dan: I think I jellied my dough.


5. Player: What?


6. Brittany: Yeah… what?


7. Dan: I think I jellied my dough.


8. Player: What does that mean?


9. Dan: I think some of my jelly spilled out from my dough.
10. Dan: When I get scared I leak a little.


11. Brittany: Oh. Gotcha.


12. Player: I think that’s the human equivalent of peeing your pants.


13. Dan: What are pants?
