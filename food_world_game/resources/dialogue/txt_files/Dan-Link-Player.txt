Fusion Fears
1. PLAY: player_level=|>=|1
2. PLAY_WHEN: user


3. Dan: Link, I'm afraid that one of these times we fuse, you'll let me loose and send me flying!
4. Dan: I can handle the dizziness, but I can't handle the altitude!


5. Link: I'd never let you go, bro. Never.


6. Player: What if I let you both go though?
7. Player: Link's grease makes my hands all slippery.


8. Dan: Hold on tighter!


9. Link: What am I, a chew toy?! Don't squeeze me any harder!


10. Player: It seems we'll just have to hope nobody gets sent flying!
