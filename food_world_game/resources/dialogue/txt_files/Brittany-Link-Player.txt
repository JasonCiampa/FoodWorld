3. Link: Brittany, if we're ever running low on juice, feel free to use my grease!
4. Link: It's quite nutritious and has a kick to it!


5. Brittany: No, I don't think that'll be necessary.


6. Player: Well, you never really know right?
7. Player: What if we get trapped somewhere and can't forage any berries?
8. Player: Could we survive on Link's grease if we had to?


9. Brittany: Maybe, but I don't think anyone would enjoy it aside from Link.


10. Link: What?! Now that's just rude. You can't knock it till you've tried it!
11. Link: Why do we always gotta drink YOUR kind of juice, Brittany? Why?!


12. Brittany: My juice has actual nutrition. Yours is basically sweat.


13. Player: Oh jeez, well when you put it like that it's a hard no from me.
14. Player: Link, I don't think we'll need to consume your grease. 
15. Player: Maybe we can use it for something else down the line.


16. Link: We'd better!!
